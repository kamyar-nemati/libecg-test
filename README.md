# Repository name: libecg-test
A Command Line Interface (CLI) prototype for libecg repo to measure signal compression performance and distortion.

## Repo Description
The prototype application is a test scenario to examine the integrity of the hybrid compression algorithm proposed by _libecg_. It compresses and then decompresses given signal based on given Threshold and Aperture as inputs to measure __Compression Ratio__, __Percent Root-Mean-Square Difference__, and __Quality Score__. Next, it utilizes ChartDirector library to create a line chart of the overlapping signals (original and reconstructed) to visually demonstrate the signal distortion.

Lastly, the prototype attempts to compress the signal again, but this time within a limited range of threshold and aperture (which means compressing it multiple times) in order to reveal the affect of different input factors.
